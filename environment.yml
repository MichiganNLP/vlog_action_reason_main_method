    # We could use the Anaconda channel "HuggingFace".
    # However, `tokenizers` was compiled with glibc 2.18, while Great Lakes has 2.17.
    # See https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/issues/585
    # There are some non-popular glibc packages available in Anaconda, but Python needs to be linked to it as well.
    # This is cumbersome, so we just use pip.
